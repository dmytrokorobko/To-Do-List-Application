# Task 1: Build a To-Do List Application

## Features

1. **Components and Props**: 
    - Create components for the header, to-do item, and footer.
    - Pass data via props to the to-do item component.

2. **Hooks**: 
    - Use `useState` to manage the state of the to-do list items.
    - Use `useEffect` to fetch initial to-do items from a mock API.

3. **Promises and Async/Await**: 
    - Fetch to-do items from a mock API using `async/await` in `useEffect`.

4. **React Router**: 
    - Add routes for different views like "All Tasks", "Completed Tasks", "Pending Tasks", and "New Task".

5. **Jest and RTL Testing**: 
    - Write tests for the components to ensure they render correctly.
    - Verify that the functionalities work as expected.
